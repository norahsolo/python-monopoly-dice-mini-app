###Auto Dice Roller for Monopoly:

Let's create an automatic dice roller for a game of Monopoly! <img src="http://monopoly-slot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/monopoly-slot.jpg" width="200px" align="right" hspace="10">

In Monopoly, at the beginning of each turn a player rolls two six sided dice. The numbers rolled on each die are added together to tell the player how many spaces to move. If the player rolls doubles, if they roll the same value on each die, then  Every time we run it, it will tell us how many spaces we should move, and if we have rolled doubles and get to go again.

The program should print a string that looks something like this if you roll doubles:

Doubles! Move 6 spaces and roll again.

And if you don't roll doubles:

Move 8 spaces. Next player's turn!

Remember to import your random library at the start of your script!
